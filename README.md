# git-author-rewrite

A simple command-line tool to update author information in your Git commit history.

## Why this tool?

Ever needed to update your commit history because:
- You forgot to set your Git email correctly
- Your company changed email domains
- You want to sync personal and work commits

`git-author-rewrite` helps you fix these issues without affecting other contributors' work.

## Features

- Update author name and email in commit history
- Preserve commit dates and messages
- Keep other contributors' commits unchanged
- Simple command-line interface

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ideftbuild/git-author-rewrite
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic usage
git-author-rewrite --email <old-email> <new-email>

# Update both name and email
git-author-rewrite --email <old-email> <new-email> --name <old-name> <new-name>
```

## Usage Guide

To rewrite only the email address, run the following command:

```bash
git-author-rewrite --email <old-email> <new-email>
```

To rewrite only the author name, use this command:

```bash

```

To rewrite both the email address and the author name, use the command below:

```bash
git-author-rewrite --email <old-email> <new-email> --name <old-name> <new-name>
```

## Common Use Cases

2. Fixing misconfigured author
   ```bash
    git-author-rewrite --email "name@oldcompany.com" "name@newcompany.com" --name "old name" "new name"
   ```
